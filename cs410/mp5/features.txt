1. [classifier]
method = "knn"
k=10
[classifier.ranker]
method = "bm25"
//loss = "hinge"
//prefix = "sgd-model"

2. The new classifier that I used, which was knn,  decreased the accuracy by about 0.1. The accuracy before was around 0.82 but now has gone down to around 0.73. 

3. According to the confusion matrix, the classifier as knn made the same mistakes as the original classifier. The original classifier had a high level of confusion between “HKG and CHN” and “TWN and CHN”. The knn classifier also had increased confusion between these classes. 

4. The null hypothesis would be that there is no correlation between the accuracy and the classifier. We would then test whether the p value is more than 5% difference which is attributed to randomness. If not, then the classifier that has the higher accuracy is better.
