This week's materials started off with the different elements of how a sentence is made, and how many things we take for granted are not so obvious to the system. The first example of this is the idea of being ambiguous in a sentence. By doing this you add a level of uncertainty that the computer can not make an assumption of unless given more information. Due to this being evrywhere the system can not properly tag 100% of the text that it processes. This is why in most systems they have a very shallow understanding of what is the text is saying. For the most part this is fine for most searches. A way to improve this is to add feedback to the system so they can give better definitions by storing it in the query.
Then the week progressing into the two main categories of text analysis: Push and Pull. The best example of Pull is when you do a simple search on Google or another other search engine. Push is mainly when the system gives you information based on your past searches. So an example of this would be Amazon's reccommended items for you part. 
After this the week goes into the types of Text Retreval problems that you may run into. The two main problems that you will run into are with regards to either Document Selection versus Document Ranking. Document selection will only give you results that contain the words you are searching for and will denote a 0 or 1 with whether the document is relevant or not. Document Ranking is in main regrads to see which document is more relevant than that of another document.
Finally the week goes into the various models that are there for text retreval and the Vector Space Model. The professor starts off with a basic image of the VSM and then goes into the issues and the various elements that need to be taken into consideration to make a better model.
