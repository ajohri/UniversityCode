ProjectID: 24
Summary: The project is called Deep History. What this project does is that apart from searching up the title of a historical event it also parses through the text on the page to see if it is relevant to the title or not. This is becaues a lot of modern articles have misleading titles and if one is looking for a historical event it's hard to find it with these modern articles.
