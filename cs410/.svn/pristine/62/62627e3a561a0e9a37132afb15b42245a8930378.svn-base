NLP - Natural Language Processing
This is what the computer does in order to understand a sentence
Need to understand the syntax to the sentence
Find the structure of the sentence
Syntactical analysis - We can get most of this
Semantic analysis - This is harder since we don’t know tone and common sense, Works well with some entities and not so well for other entities
Pragmatic analysis - Not quite there yet because inference is hard to determine
Ambiguity is killer to the computer

Can’t do 100% of the speech tagging
Shallow analysis is the best way - the text needs to be general robost & efficient

Feedback - allows us to add aditional words to the query

Two modes of text access - Push and Pull
Pull - The user takes initiative (Search Engines)
	ad hoc  - temporary infomation
Push - The system takes initiative
