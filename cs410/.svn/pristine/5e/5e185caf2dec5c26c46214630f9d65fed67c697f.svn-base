This week we start going into the concept of Text Mining and Analytics. This process is turning text data into high-quality information or actionable knowledge by minimizing human effort. How we first start off with all of this is by mining knowledge about a langauge. This comes mainly from knowing the context of where the language appears. Then we go into mining content of text data while also mining knowledge about the observer. Then finally we infer other real-world variables. This leads us to a predictive analysis of everything. Text representation determines what kind of mining algorithms can be applied. Then the rest of the week went into how all the parts described above tie in together.
