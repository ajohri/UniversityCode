One way to combat concept spam is to limit the maximum number of times a concept can occer. Then for every time that it goes over the said limit you should start penelizing that word. This way if the limit is 200 for a word like "the" which may occur more than 200 times will be penelized and have a lower value than a word like "document" when it may have 120 occurances. This will allow you to get rid of a lot of conetnt spam and get down to the information that you need.
