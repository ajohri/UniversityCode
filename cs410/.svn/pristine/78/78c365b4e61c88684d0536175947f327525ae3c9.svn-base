This week talked about text clustering and how some of the uses for it are to get a sense about the overall content of the collection. It also helps link similar text objects. With this you can create a structure on the text data. Then after that the cluster allocation after parameter estimation. Then we can cluster how each document belongs to ?cd=? With this we can see the likelihood of a document.
