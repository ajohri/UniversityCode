3) Looking at the document's contents, I do think that the topic assignments that the LDA gave me are reasonable. Reading the paragraphs, you can see that for Topic 1, when we predicted that topic 1 would be about software programming languages looking at the word distributions, the paragraph from the documents consists of topics around Java and XML. Furthermore, in the last paragraph resulting to predicted database querying, we see discussion of DBMS. However, it talks about conceptual-to-logic schemata transformation process as well. What I gain from this analysis is the understanding that we may make an assumption on the general topic given the word distributions and rankings but we need to look at all the top 20 words for each topic.
