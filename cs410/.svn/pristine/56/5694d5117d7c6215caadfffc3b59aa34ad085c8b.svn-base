This week's material brings back the push and pull techniques we discussed in the beginning of this course. We can now see how search engines are like a pull process and the reccomender is the push process. Then the lecture goes into how to improve the reccomender system by asking a simple question: Will User U like item X? This question is constantly asked even after the initialization of the reccomender in the begining. This can then be expanded to not just items but matching up people's profiles based on how similar their reccomender is.
