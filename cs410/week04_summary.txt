This week started off by talking about two different smoothing methods. The first one is Jelinek-Mercer which has a fixed linear interpolation. The second one is Dirichlet Prior and this adds psuedo counts leading to an adaptive interpolation. After talking about these methods it goes into how the Feedback part of the process works. There are many different typs of Feedback such as: Relevance, Pseudo/Blind/Automatic, and Implicit. Each one has different levels of interaction with the user to not letting the user decide how the results are to giving the user complete control over the feedback given to the system. The second to last lecture goes into another Feedback style of Rocchio's Feedback where it starts to clump relavent and non-relavent documents together in a 3D space.
