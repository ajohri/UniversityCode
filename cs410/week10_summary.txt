This week started talking about how to topic mine and then analyze what you mine from all of that. It starts of with a sample of mixed topics and then continues into how to mine with multiple topics as well. After that the professor goes into Probabilitic Latent Semantic Analysis and talks about the different parts to the entire equation. With this in had he goes into the ML Parameter Estimation. The output of this can enable many different applications when it comes to the clustering of terms.
