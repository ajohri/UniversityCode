This week's lectures went into depth about the implementation of how to tackle the TF questions. The first technique that was mentioned was about tokenizing word by nomalizing the meanings for each word. By doing this you go into indexing all the words and from this you build on the feedback. By doing this you start to bundle words that have a similar meanings so that you can get the meaning of the sentence faster. Then the lectures when into Zipf's law on how there is a relationship with on how much a word gets uses and follows a certain path. Then lectures went into the Data Structures need for certain situations.
